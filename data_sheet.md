# Datasheet Template

As far as you can, complete the model datasheet. If you have got the data from the internet, you may not have all the information you need, but make sure you include all the information you do have. 

## Motivation

- For what purpose was the dataset created? 
This dataset was created for the sole purpose of investigating the suitability of neural-networks to price financial derivatives.
- Who created the dataset (e.g., which team, research group) and on behalf of which entity (e.g., company, institution, organization)? Who funded the creation of the dataset?
The dataset was created by me as part of my project work for the Professional Certificate in Machine Learning and AI from Imperial College, London.
 
## Composition

- What do the instances that comprise the dataset represent (e.g., documents, photos, people, countries)? 
Input and output parameters to the Black-Scholes pricing model

- How many instances of each type are there? 
The dataset contains 3,980,025 rows
- Is there any missing data?
There is no missing data.
- Does the dataset contain data that might be considered confidential (e.g., data that is protected by legal privilege or by    doctor–patient confidentiality, data that includes the content of individuals’ non-public communications)?
The data is not confidential and can be easily reproduced independently.

## Collection process

- How was the data acquired? 
The data was created using the Black-Scholes pricing model and a for loop.
- If the data is a sample of a larger subset, what was the sampling strategy? 
The dataset is complete.
- Over what time frame was the data collected?
As part of the project work in July 2024

## Preprocessing/cleaning/labelling

- Was any preprocessing/cleaning/labeling of the data done (e.g., discretization or bucketing, tokenization, part-of-speech tagging, SIFT feature extraction, removal of instances, processing of missing values)? If so, please provide a description. If not, you may skip the remaining questions in this section. 
None required
- Was the “raw” data saved in addition to the preprocessed/cleaned/labeled data (e.g., to support unanticipated future uses)? 
N/A
 
## Uses

- What other tasks could the dataset be used for? 
Anybody can use this dataset for anything, but given the ease by which it can be recreated we suggest generating any similar data you require yourself.
- Is there anything about the composition of the dataset or the way it was collected and preprocessed/cleaned/labeled that might impact future uses? For example, is there anything that a dataset consumer might need to know to avoid uses that could result in unfair treatment of individuals or groups (e.g., stereotyping, quality of service issues) or other risks or harms (e.g., legal risks, financial harms)? If so, please provide a description. Is there anything a dataset consumer could do to mitigate these risks or harms? 
N/A
- Are there tasks for which the dataset should not be used? If so, please provide a description.
N/A

## Distribution

- How has the dataset already been distributed? 
n/a
- Is it subject to any copyright or other intellectual property (IP) license, and/or under applicable terms of use (ToU)?  
No

## Maintenance

- Who maintains the dataset?
The dataset is not maintained.
